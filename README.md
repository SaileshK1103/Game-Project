# 1. Game-Project
The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed and comprehensive requirement specification for the Game "Vaccine Quest". The document is targeted towards developers, project stakeholders, and testers, outlining the exact functionalities and requirements of the game. It aims to eliminate ambiguities in the development process, ensuring a common understanding of how the game should work and how users will interact with it. The document is organized into four main chapters: Introduction, Vision, Functional Requirements, and Quality Requirements.
# 2. Vision
The Flight Simulator Game "Vaccine Quest" is a console-based, interactive game where the player takes on a mission to save the world from a global health crisis by collecting essential vaccine components. The game provides an educational and engaging experience, where players fly between airports in Europe to collect elements A, B, C and D, which are necessary for the creation of a vaccine.

The player starts at a random airport with a certain budget and a limited range for their aircraft. At each airport, the player may find one of the essential elements or a lucky box, which they can open by spending part of their budget. The lucky box may contain an additional vaccine component or be empty. The objective of the game is to collect all three elements within the given budget and range, thereby winning the game. The player must carefully decide which airports to visit while managing their resources.

The game proceeds in stages:

- The player is given a budget and initial location.
- The player can choose the next airport to fly to, within the limited range.
- Upon arriving at an airport, the player may discover a vaccine element or a lucky box.
- The player continues to visit airports until they have collected all required elements or run out of resources.
The main idea is to provide a strategic challenge where players must optimize their choices to achieve the goal while managing limited resources.
# 3. Functional Requirement
The following functional requirements are presented as user stories:

- As a player, I can start a new game by providing my screen name, so that I can begin my mission.

- As a player, I can collect an element if it is available at the airport, so that I can progress towards my goal of creating the vaccine.
- As a player, I can decide whether to open a lucky box for $100, so that I can potentially gain an additional element.
- As a player, I receive feedback if the lucky box is empty or contains an element, so that I know the outcome of my actions.
- As a player, I can view a list of airports within my current range, so that I can plan my next move.
- As a player, I can enter the ICAO code of an airport to travel to, so that I can move to my chosen destination.
